connormce10: Sam, fuck off
Lawn: it's too easy, and not enough practice
Apathy: yes connor: it adds no value to the game objective
Lawn: but yeah sam, your life is a lie

Nick: xyz holding it down on D
Sam: afk kill != spawn kill.......haha
*(RED_C)*: CRIP VS BLOOD
meme guy: afk kill is spawn kill but in FFA
Nup: but usually "killing at spawn" is usually not helpful unless a flag is out.
Lawn: afk kills are fine tho in ffa
connormce10: indeed
connormce10: in FFA, slaughter the weak
meme guy: 25 points, meh
connormce10: but big numbers
Apathy: you could also open 10 more sessions on the other team, and do nothing with the planes
Apathy: it adds value to a degree
Nick#592: lol nice shot
Apathy: but just like spawn killing its not the game objective
Nick: i feel extra competitive with a fellow nick
Lawn: lol apathy
Nick#592: yeah same I'm usually the only nick and ive gotten pretty good lately

Kaizo: what did I do to poor top gun?

Lawn: u have kaizo and steam and its 21 20

Lawn: fair now
Lawn: 21-21
Maximus Decimus: its not about numbers
Lawn: ik
Maximus Decimus: its about balancing the top pilots
Lawn: they have top pilots
Apathy: is it balansed?
34643674645736534256: its about cheat

xyz: bombita's mod?
Lawn: yeah
Lawn: what is it for again?
Lawn: kaikai gone
Apathy: thanks for the upgrade
Maximus Decimus: okay, you're 1v1 in the enemy base.
Maximus Decimus: what ship gives you the most fear, what ship gives you the least fear?
Maximus Decimus: I would say most fearful is a pred, least fearful is a goli
dan dan yes he can: same
STEAMROLLER: depends on the player
Lawn: tbh, probably tornado, then heli.
Lawn: but yeah depends
Maximus Decimus: lol that damn bouncy castle
Nup: is leaving with flag mandatory?
Maximus Decimus: i literally bounced straight up into steamroller's missile :(
Maximus Decimus: of course
Lawn: haha
Lawn: hi origin, wrong team

Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: yeah, it's unfortunite lol, lets see how it goes
Lawn: ooooh that heli glow looks dank, max
Maximus Decimus: okay, best escort ship?
Maximus Decimus: I would argue heli
error 404: ERROR 404 FLAG NOT FOUND
STEAMROLLER: usually pred
Maximus Decimus: lol error 404
Lawn: heli, but with a few others
STEAMROLLER: sometimes heli
Maximus Decimus: steamroller, max flies in to escort you
meme guy: heli 4 SPAM
Maximus Decimus: you'd rather see him in heli?
Lawn: no
Maximus Decimus: no pred
STEAMROLLER: not sure on that one, max in heli is pretty good
Lawn: well, fair point. depends, but heli or pred
STEAMROLLER: but max alone in heli might not be enough
Lawn: what abt recap? i'd say heli, lots of spread damage
111111111: matt come with me
STEAMROLLER: a good heli on recap can really screw over a cap attempt
joe stupid: tt
littlebrownboy: can i shoot u guy for phone
littlebrownboy: fun
Maximus Decimus: of course, as Top Gun just demonstrated, it is vulnerable to prowler.
Lawn: dang, i just watched y'all gang rape max
Maximus Decimus: I think prowler health needs to be nerfed
xyz: lol memer is level 4
Lawn: i agree max
littlebrownboy: `
STEAMROLLER: so it would be a one shot by pred?
xyz: any updates on the development of this game?
meme guy: memer plays like lvl 20 but only 4
Lawn: he is basically a lvl 30
Maximus Decimus: now now, let's not go that far.
Maximus Decimus: at best, level 25
meme guy: more like 50
xyz: haha
STEAMROLLER: lol
Lawn: haha i thought i'd hear u ma
Lawn: x
littlebrownboy: ` what does it mean

Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: damn X
Maximus Decimus: one thing I do judge folks here on is how many ships they can competently fly
Maximus Decimus: very few here do more than 2.
Lawn: what's my score?
meme guy: just say he is REALLY GOOD
Top Gun: lol dan
kjb: i can do 4
STEAMROLLER: I think I'm about 2
STEAMROLLER: maybe 1.5 ships that I can fly
Nup: i think it takes a special person to fly a tornado
meme guy: i can fly 1
Maximus Decimus: aimbot, basically
Apathy: lol Nup
Lawn: amen, nup
Apathy: agreed
Maximus Decimus: anyway, point is Memer flies 3 ships well
Lawn: true
Lawn: i'd say i'm 2.5

Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: *coach
Nick#934: wow just saw teams are crazy unbalanced
Nick#934: 20 to 12
Vanish: Yeah, people quit when they start losing
Nick#934: ah
STEAMROLLER: that explains a lot
Nick#934: vicious cycle
Vanish: Really, the 1st point is the most important one
Top Gun: gg
STEAMROLLER: thats game
steamboat: gg
:|: gg
Gevious: gg
Lu1g1: ferocious!
Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: truthfully i din't do sht
airman: i was in def the whole time
Grace: gg but shitty split
Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: that was all escort lol
airman: and saw origin come with flag 3 times
Detect: Switched to blue to balance teams. 13 blue vs 16 red
Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: ima go for 20k again

Nup: teams even now
:|: lol
Grace: -prow-pong
#CantStumpTheTrump: lmao
#CantStumpTheTrump: this
#CantStumpTheTrump: this is basically a hack
jz: i don't get it
#CantStumpTheTrump: it finds prowlers on your screen
Grace: what?
jz: requires running a mod i assume?
#CantStumpTheTrump: yes
Grace: can't be exact pos right?
Grace: because server isn't that fine grained
Lawn: "cannot find prowlers"
:|: reveals friendly prowlers
BadSushi: keeeeek
praise kek: xplaaaaay
Lawn: gtg
STEAMROLLER: cya
BadSushi: that was a cool run till this safd moment
BadSushi: sad
praise kek: red really sucks, either Detect or Sushi should switch
STEAMROLLER: not sure they are able to
:|: its pretty balanced
BadSushi: i think so too
jz: i mean, the steams are divided
Hermes: Should I?
Lu1g1: yup
Hermes: kk
Hermes: still blue
Hermes: again
Ôò¼┬«┬¡├ÿ├ë┬¢┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë├í┬¡├ÿ├ë├│┬¡├ÿ├ë┬║: ima go, cya guys
Hermes: cya
:|: need more prowlers
Hermes: wWwd
Hermes: oops
Mohammed The Rapist: 90% sure the entire red team is mildy retarded, or really bad AI
fart sniffer: which half are you :)
Lu1g1: why is everyone dissing their own team?
Vanish: Red team is shortstaffed. Also, maybe not the smartest.
:|: lmao
Vanish: Sorry, but "not the smartest" I meant "not playing as a team"
Mohammed The Rapist: i'm mohammed!  i rape children!
Nup: votemute
STEAMROLLER: yup, voted
STEAMROLLER: he just left
snek: good riddence
STEAMROLLER: and probably rejoined as small asian cunt
Nup: hey, watch your language.
Nup: ;)
Small Asian Cunt: hi
Nup: please vote liberally
OhBreezy: died for the flag :D
Nick: nice shooting derp haha
fart sniffer: gg
Boom: gg

OhBreezy: that shuffle tho
Grace: lol
Grace: double drop
Grace: and I'm out
Grace: seeya
Grace: have fun :)
STEAMROLLER: cya
steamboat: how do you spectate? I've literally never done it
OhBreezy: bye
Detect: cu
STEAMROLLER: hit V
Hermes: yup
steamboat: sweet
STEAMROLLER: lol the shuffle
STEAMROLLER: 12 v 20
Hermes: blue or red
Hermes: ?
STEAMROLLER: now 15 blue v 18
Nup: does it matter?
STEAMROLLER: imma sit this one out
Nup: i guess it does.. no reason to rejoin if you're on the lower team.
im a kill, dont noob: what does the bot do
STEAMROLLER: its logging game events so that I can compile some game stats
STEAMROLLER: It doesn't show you prowlers though :(
ME!!!: i r
Nup: who is statsbot spectating? :)
ME!!!: i ran right into a missile and died
spec: ok i finally got a display that's > 30hz
Agent P.A.N.D.A: gg!
Boom: system reshuffles to equal out teams. Creates team with only good people
Jasper: Im invis
steamboat: getting unexpected lag, gonna drop off, cya
meme guy: bte
STEAMROLLER: cya
meme guy: bye
praise kek: JUST
Rocket Scientist: sneaky bastards
STEAMROLLER: I'm in first, does that mean I have to be heli?
Nup: no.  but you can call it if someone takes it? :)
Rocket Scientist: damn prowlers
meme guy: theres dreamer/memer and memer/dreamer
meme guy: spec, what is ur missile speed?
spec: too slow :(
meme guy: how many upgrades>
fart sniffer: real men play with 0 upgrades
meme guy: i rarely use upgrades
meme guy: unless i have 5
arjun: coming
meme guy: no
spec: i use upgrades and try not to die
spec: but im getting used to new setup
spec: dying a lot :(
arjun: hi badsushi
PUTOS: I was having a nice fight with Detect and a prowler came to ruin the whole thing
fart sniffer: prowlers suck
praise kek: shit
Nup: teamwork...
arjun: hey! INVISIBILITY
arjun: matterd.....
meme guy: spec, how much missile speed upgrades do you have?
spec: trade secret
spec: detect is at 5
meme guy: i think its 125%
meme guy: (max)
spec: you are pretty annoying for a tornado
meme guy: spec prob has 125% misle sped
meme guy: meh, im starting to use it then pred
spec: imo tornado is worst ship
meme guy: multifire is op
meme guy: kinda
meme guy: gg
PUTOS: gg
STEAMROLLER: gg
Jason: gg
Detect: gg
noodles: gg
Sailor Jerry: gg
spec: imo tornado only works against players who are worse than yuo
woot: gg
meme guy: o
spec: i sometimes mess with it when my team is OP
UnfrozenCavemanLawyr: lol found some prowlers camping base. oops!
Sailor Jerry: not true, tornado takes some practice but is powerful. Best upgrades are speed
spec: if you get 5/0/0/5 upgrades it can handle unpgraded pred sort of ok
meme guy: tornado is new 4 me
spec: but otherwise you're relying on the other player to walk into a triple shot
Nup: AlexB does well in tornado
spec: and if the pred is upgraded it's hopeless
meme guy: tom cang xanh is good too
spec: i kill alexb basically every time (no offense to him)
STEAMROLLER: is anyone else having the client become really laggy?
spec: yeah tom too
Sailor Jerry: nope
spec: steam, sometimes, but not right now
spec: chrome works way better than firefox for me
STEAMROLLER: gonna try a restart
steamboat: I did earlier steamroller
Nup: i reload the browser if my client becomes choppy
steamboat: switched computer
ZYZZ: cause you using the mod, thats why
meme guy: steam always is pred
Nup: my chop isn't mod based
spec: steam and jabba are the best torndaos imo
spec: and they still can't handle a good pred, again just imo
Nup: i think it depends on the location
meme guy: should i return to prred?
STEAMROLLER: ok much better
Sailor Jerry: salty from last round detect?
spec: i think tornado is fun to use
spec: so i wouldnt say you shouldn't use it
meme guy: multifire
STEAMROLLER: tornado is pretty good in FFA
Nup: what kinda ships do you sail, jerry?
steamboat: I feel like everyone who regularly plays CTF can be top 3 within 5 minutes in FFA
jz: yup
STEAMROLLER: pretty much
meme guy: ffa isez
spec: yeah i think that's true
meme guy: ffa is ez
steamboat: quite a talent disparity
ZYZZ: thats y they play ctf steam. ffa is too easy
meme guy: btr, meh
spec: it's so easy to level up in btr
STEAMROLLER: BTR can be fun
spec: it's basically always all noobs
im a kill, dont noob: hey
spec: and you get so many points
meme guy: that time with u, korea and apathy in BTR
spec: btr would be fun with good players, but it's soooo rare
spec: korea would dominate if he didn't have such high ping
meme guy: friendo played today
spec: i should ask him for a duel in the asia server next time i see him
meme guy: i got about 30000 bounty
spec: i've never seen him play without 170 ping or whatever
im a kill, dont noob: have to wait too long in btr
meme guy: true
spec: i wish btr started with a smaller map
spec: even with 40 players the map couldl be half size
meme guy: no respawns, meh
spec: and it's usually like 7 players
meme guy: 20 mid day
spec: subspace speed zone was a better setup
spec: you have a timer, and you get time for kills
spec: so people don't just run all the time
STEAMROLLER: that'd be interesting
spec: wait that's koth. speed zone was just race for points
spec: if your timer runs out, you can still play, but you're in the running to win
spec: so you don't have forced spec
meme guy: CTF is where elites reside
emily: diego??
tired of ur shit: ye
emily: what color
tired of ur shit: red
spec: the problem is, in all the other game modes, running away is the optimal strategy
emily: kys
spec: ctf is the only game mode where it makes sense to ever attack
meme guy: im more aggresive
spec: in btr you can kill noobs for upgrades, but it never makes sense to fight a good player early
spec: since you're wasting valuable time you could be using to farm upgrades from noobs
meme guy: or afk
spec: i'm pretty aggressive in btr and ffa ,but that's a suboptimal strategy
meme guy: all my friends play BTR, they are new
STEAMROLLER: I usually just go after golis in FFA
potato: why do escorts stay so close to the carrier
noodles: /
potato: makes more sense to spread out imo
STEAMROLLER: it protects against prowlers
meme guy: goli v heli, FFA
spec: btr is good if you're new since the level of play isn't super high usually
Sailor Jerry: blocking?
jz: and you're ready to grab if carrier dies
spec: so you can play without some one using scalefactor
meme guy: blocj=k missles
spec: owning you from offscreen 10 times in a row
Nup: you need some escorts to pick up immediately
Nup: and some escorts to destroy attackers
potato: so get closer when enemies approach
STEAMROLLER: need a ball for the last part in base
meme guy: ionly run away from people who keep on killing me
STEAMROLLER: so a prow sitting in base doesnt take out the flag carrier
potato: but prevent them from getting there in the first place
STEAMROLLER: that doesn't always happen
STEAMROLLER: and good prows can get in the base alot
spec: it's too bad people are using prowlers more
spec: since it makes the game super boring
meme guy: gtg, gn
spec: but it's also the right strategy
spec: bye
meme guy: cya
spec: two upgraded prowlers can take out basically any flag carrier unless the escort is perfect
spec: which you almost never see
STEAMROLLER: good prows can really shut down offense
ZYZZ: lost cause game lel
spec: i've done it when there's another good player in prowler and we're otherwise screwed
spec: but its so boring
jz: you still need someone to slow down the escort
spec: 5 speed prowler can catch flag carrier
jz: prowlers can't cath up otherwise
jz: *catch
jz: ya?
spec: i think you only need 3 speed
spec: 4 is definitely enough
STEAMROLLER: 3 speed seems right
noodles: oh my gosh my team doesnt know how to play defense
snek: sorry - was asleep for a few minutes there
spec: btw this was aimbot. i'm trying to get used to a regular display
spec: instead of a huge display that's 30 hz
OhBreezy: gg
spec: this should be better but i still can't aim
spec: later folks
snek: gg
steamboat: gg
potato: gg
tired of ur shit: em u still here
PUTOS: gg
STEAMROLLER: cya spec
Nup: ack
STEAMROLLER: gg
tired of ur shit: gg
woot: gg
Jason: gg
Nup: i was reading instead of recapping
111111111: how to do chat to specific person
STEAMROLLER: I was chatting instead of playing
tired of ur shit: EM
jz: woot! just hit 20k kills overall
woot: do /w [name]
STEAMROLLER: do /w PersonName to whisper to them
Jason: most of the team was
steamboat: nice jz
Nup: what do you mean by "30hz"?
jz: i'm 20k/4.8k
STEAMROLLER: probably monitor
Nup: not sure how refresh rate affects anything?
STEAMROLLER: I could see how it could throw of your aim
111111111: lol
Nup: lovers? what?
jz: lol
jz: was fun to try ;-)
jz: it's like bullriding. when that many enemies around, you just try to last 8 seconds
jz: wow nup, you lasted longer than i expected. well done
jz: longer than me anyway ;-)
OhBreezy: :/
OhBreezy: i was typing :9
fart sniffer: silly place to start typing
OhBreezy: lol true
Nup: i once passed to a goli who was typing. :P
steamboat: chaos over there
Detect: meat shield
Nup: he started moving but counldn't use special

Bees!: type h and read instructions :)
